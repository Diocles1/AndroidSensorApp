## Android Sensor Application
- Using accelerometer sensor to print current values and play Super Mario sounds to certain acc values.
- Using position sensor to identify current cardinal direction and play familiar north-related anthem when in N-direction.


### Structure
Three activities: MainActivity, Compass, AccMeter. Names pretty much describe them.
 - MainActivity: Built through Androids tutorials.
 - Compass: Pretty much copy paste from tutorial stated beneath. Song added and to be played between degrees 350 - 10. 
 - AccMeter: Based on sensor handling tutorials, though most of the code is self made. Especially code handling motion/sound mapping.
